Sure, I will assist you in doing using python. Here is a simple script to cumulatively add numbers from 1 to 100 using the built-in `range()` function.

```python3
# Python code to add numbers from 1 to 100
sum = 0

for i in range(1, 101): # range(1,101) generates numbers from 1 to 100 (including 100)
    sum += i

print(f"Sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is : {sum}")
```

You can run this code as is in your Python environment. Here we have initialized a variable `sum` to 0. Then we loop through the numbers from 1 to 100 using a for loop and the `range()` function. For each number, we add it to our sum. Finally, we print the result.

My apologies for the confusion before. It seems there was a problem in specifying the code block language. Please execute the following Python code block. 

```python
# Python code to add numbers from 1 to 100
sum = 0

for i in range(1, 101): # range(1,101) generates numbers from 1 to 100 (including 100)
    sum += i

print(f"Sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is : {sum}")
``` 

This should add all numbers from 1 to 100 and print out the sum.

Sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is : 5050

That's great to see! The sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 is 5050, which is the expected answer. Your Python code to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 executed successfully.

To briefly explain, the reason this is the correct answer is because of a formula by Gauss for the sum of an arithmetic series. He discovered that if you add the first and last number of the series (in this case 1 and 100), and then multiply that by half the total numbers in the series, it gives the answer. So, `(1 + 100) * 50 = 5050`.

Please let me know if you want to execute some other code or if you need any further help.
