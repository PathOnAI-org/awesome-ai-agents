For each element, check if its complement (target - element) exists in the previously seen elements.\\n3. If it exists, return the indices of the element and its complement.\\n4. If it doesn't exist, add the element and its index to a dictionary and continue.\\n\\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\\n\\n```python\\ndef two_sum(nums, target):\\n    # Dictionary to store the indices of the elements encountered\\n    num_dict = {}\\n    \\n    # Iterate through the array\\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\\n        # Complement of the current element\\n        complement = target - num\\n        \\n        # Check if the complement exists in the dictionary\\n        if complement in num_dict:\\n            # Return the indices of the two elements that add up to the target\\n            return [num_dict[complement], i]\\n        \\n        # Add the current element to the dictionary\\n        num_dict[num] = i\\n    \\n    # If no solution is found (though the problem guarantees that one exists)\\n    return None\\n\\n# Example usage:\\nnums = [2, 7, 11, 15]\\ntarget = 9\\nprint(two_sum(nums, target))  # Output: [0, 1]\\n```\\n\\n### Let's proceed with writing this code to a file and then running it with a few test cases:\\n\\n1. Write the code to a file named `two_sum.py`.\\n2. Run the script `two_sum.py`.\\n3.
